# Background
This app has been built by following Stephen Grider's [Microservices with Node JS and React](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/) course.

The app is a clone of [Stubhub](https://www.stubhub.com/), where people will visit the site to buy and sell tickets to events such as concerts and sports matches.  

The following technologies and frameworks are used:
- React.js, Next.js & Typescript - Frontend
- Node.js & Express - Backend
- Docker and Kubernetes - Containerization and Orchestration
- NATS Streaming - Event Streaming
- MongoDB - Data Storage
- Jest & Supertest - Testing

This project touches on the following skillsets:
- Architecting multi-service apps
- Deployment of multi-service apps to cloud
- Limiting access to APIs using JWT authentication
- Best practices in communication between different services
